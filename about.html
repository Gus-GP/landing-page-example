                    <p>I'm a leadership and personal development coach who works with ambitious professionals stepping into new levels of responsibility and growth. I help people move forward with clarity while staying aligned with what matters most. I'm especially drawn to those who want their success to feel intentional, not accidental.</p>
                    <p>As a first-generation professional and working mom, I know what it takes to pursue meaningful goals without losing sight of your values, relationships, and wellbeing.</p>
                    <p>Over the past decade, I've led organizational development and leadership strategy work at Lockheed Martin, supporting leaders through growth, change, and complex transitions. That experience informs a coaching style grounded in strategic clarity and thoughtful reflection.</p>
                    <p><strong>I believe growth should not require sacrificing what matters most.</strong> Ambition and alignment are not opposing forces — they can and should coexist. The most effective leadership begins with self-awareness and intentional action.</p>

                <p>My coaching blends practical strategy with mindset and perspective work to help clients expand how they see themselves and their possibilities. Real growth rarely comes from quick fixes. Instead, I create space for thoughtful reflection, honest exploration, and forward movement rooted in clarity and intention.</p>
